## Main game
This game is about Hedy, a dog that has gotten lost in a forest, far away from home. The goal for the player is to find their way back home, while solving puzzles on the way there. Every level, new ways to solve puzzles and more difficult puzzles emerge.

## Programming language
The puzzles that the player has to solve are based on the Hedy programming language, a gradual programming language created and developed at Leiden University. The programming language is aimed at teaching about programming and teaching the programming language Python.

The Hedy programming language is gradual, which means that it will get more difficult to understand and write the further you continue using it. The Hedy team has compared it to learning a language:

> But there are a lot of rules you need to memorize, just like when you started to learn English. Similarly, you will need a lot of practice to learn programming.

We decided that the game will have levels that, like the Hedy language, will get more difficult and introduce more aspects of programming the furthere you progress through the game. We settled on seven levels in the game, that will correspond with the first seven levels of the programming language.

To find out more about Hedy, visit their Github repo (https://github.com/Felienne/hedy), or go to their website (https://www.hedycode.com/) to find the latest version of the programming language.
